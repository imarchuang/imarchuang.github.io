    > I am currently working with XXXX as an Enterprise Architect. Let me spend 1 minute to very briefly introduce the high level business model of XXXX. XXXX is a general contractor in the construction industry. As a general contractor, we bid projects from project Owners and help them to manage the project in TWO major aspects, namely financial risk and timeline risk. And owners could be government, or could be private property development companies. The project owners usually don't have a full-fledged project management team internally, and as part of regulations and laws required, they need to employ a General Contractor to manage their project. Let's say, a municiple government budgeted a project of building a new bridge, and XXXX successful won the bidding of this project. Aside of managing financial risk and timeline risk, XXXX will be be in charge of hiring contractors and suppliers to execute the project. XXXX's profit margin comes from the pricing differences.

    > I, within XXXX, lead a fleet of in-house software developers to build a "Mini" ERP platform for XXXX. XXXX doesn't use SAP/Dynamics365 or Salesforce to their ERP platform, as one of XXXX's major selling point to their customers is that they own the ERP solution and its related data are fully owned by XXXX.

    >Over the past 4 years tenureship with XXXX, I mainly contributed in the following THREE areas.
    > 1. As part of the reasons I was hired for my current position, I need to figure out a way to tackle their time-to-market challenges. I quickly realized the major reasoning behind this time-to-market challenge is actually related to the TWO big monolithic applications and its delivery methodologies. One monolithic was called Financial Management System, and it is running on a IBM mid-range server AS400, and the other monlithic is called G3, and it is a monolithic application born as part of the Web2.0 movement. And it is running a traditionally popular tech combo, namely JBoss AS + RedHat OS. I took a full ownership with regards to slicing and dicing these TWO monolithics and breaking them into smaller pieces of independent components, which was designed to be cloud-native applications from the get-go. On the execution side, our team members are grouped into a small product PODs, mainly based on Domain Driven Design methodologies.  
    > 1. As the business realizes more and more benefits of adopting public cloud technologies, I successfully proposed to retire our on-prem datacenter after a few rounds of discussion with our CIO. As of today, we have migrated over 90% of the workloads to Microsoft Azure, and the remaining workloads are mainly running on the AS400/IBM mid-range mainframe servers, as I couldn't find a replacement on the public cloud providers. And some other work load like file backup, networking components (Firewall, core switch etc.) are still running on-prem as well.
    > 1. XXXX has a history of 70 years in the construction industry, over which a huge sleuth of historical data has been collected. Some of these data are not even digitized, for example, some of their drawings and contract agreement are sitting in a physical file shelf; And some of these data are semi-digitized, but spreading across all individual employees' laptop. Prior to my join to XXXX, the executive management has already realized the potential values of these data. As such, it was a easier sale for me to propose to form an data engineering team. The data engineering team is meant to leverage the model cloud and well-established big-data technologies, trying to build solid data infrastructures to further mine out the insights and perform analytics out of those valuable data.
