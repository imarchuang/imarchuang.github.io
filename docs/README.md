# Welcome to iDataMarc Journey

#### 

I am leveraging this github pages to summarize my experiences in terms of building a distributed system from ground up over the past 2 years. 

The product(s) I have been striving to build is a thin version of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) platform, which is heavily tailored towards construction industry.

At this point, all the content produced here is mainly served as my technical documentation for my personal use, nevertheless all feedbacks are sill welcomed.
