## Strategy

* Why API Gateway is needed?
* Bring you legacy to your new platform OR embed your new platform to your legacy?
* x-y axis architecutre? API Gateway as x-axis, and Data Catalog as y-axis
* [Pro-Monolithic] Should Authorization Scope be distributed via a JWT token?
* Leveraging Firewall rules concepts in your products constraint policy configuration?
* Why do we need a shared-service team (aka, Team X)?
* Why cherography is prefered over orchestration in your distributed micro-services architecture?
* Can we offer a person with TWO users from TWO different authentication providers with a SSO-like experience?
* What can a Anti-Corruption Layer bring you? FormIO-Shadow, GSuite-Shadow etc.

## Distributed Systems
* Open Tracing with Datadog
* 2-PC, 3-PC and TCC, why not Saga?

## Distributed Building Blocks
* Using Zookeeper vs Redis are your distributed lock provider
* Best rate limiter?

## DevOps
* Do you have a agile-driven CI/CD pipeline?

## Data Analytics & Warehousing
* Is a ElasticSearch Cluster good enough as your enterprise global indexer?
